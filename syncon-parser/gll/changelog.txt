0.3.0.7 -> 0.3.0.8
  + export maximumPivots and maximumPivotAtNt
0.3.0.8 -> 0.3.0.9
  + include bit of the input string when showing an error message (without whitespace)
  + exporting <multiple/some/many>SepBy2
  + exporting within, parens, braces, brackets, angles, quotes and dquotes
  + added character literals to Token type
  + exporting <:=
  + <<<**> and <**>>> for shortest and longest match, respectively
    defined some/many and variants using <**>>> and <<<**>
    disambiguation remains very experimental 
0.3.0.9 -> 0.3.0.10
  + exporting chooses
0.3.0.10 -> 0.3.0.11
  + parse option for disabling select test (lookahead)

0.3.0.11 -> 0.4.0.1
  + replaced parser by reduced descriptor GLL (RGLL)
  + renamed GLL.Types.Grammar to GLL.Types.Derivations
  + renamed GLL.Types.Abstract to GLL.Types.Grammar
  + exporting GLL.Types.Grammar, GLL.Types.Derivations, GLL.Combinators.Options, GLL.Combinators.Memoisation, GLL.Flags

0.4.0.1 -> 0.4.0.2
  + generalised `within`
  + different whitespace and comment handling in predefined lexer
  + predefined lexer handles (nested) comment-blocks

0.4.0.2 -> 0.4.0.3
  M added hex, octal and binary representation to integer literals
  + added float literals
  + exporting `preferably` and `reluctantly`
  M renamed `rassoc` to shortest_match
  M renamed `lassoc` to longest_match
  - removed `assoc`
  + version of `chooses` that is left-biased (w.r.t. alternatives)
  + generalised arguments of longest_match and shortest_match to IsAltExpr 
  + exporting `optionalWithDef`

0.4.0.3 -> 0.4.0.4
  + `chooses` cannot be given an empty list (runtime error)
  + updated `base` dependency

0.4.0.4 -> 0.4.0.5
  + relaxed cabal version constraint

0.4.0.5 -> 0.4.0.6
  + generalised the definition of `within` combinator with respect to token type

0.4.0.6 -> 0.4.0.7
  + simplified Ridge's "parsing context" in the semantic phase

0.4.0.7 -> 0.4.0.8
  + unified usage of input in both parser and combinators, speeding up initialisation of large files
  + fixed 'noSelectTest' 'ParseOption'

0.4.0.8 -> 0.4.0.9
  + reinstated a "binarised version" of the interface 
  + count number of successes in ParseResult, not just True/False

0.4.0.9 -> 0.4.0.10
  + build expression grammars from operator tables

0.4.0.10 -> 0.4.0.11
  + integer literals are now by default considered as natural numbers only, the 'signed_int_lits' flag of 'LexerSettings' can be used to turn on signed integers, restoring the behaviour of previous versions

0.4.0.11 -> 0.4.0.12
  + export 'grammarOf'
  + let 'parse' throw errors by default
  + changed priorities of operator tables to doubles 
  + removed need to specify associativity of prefix operators in operator table
